    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, $and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **  \n",
    "GaussianNB: \n",
    "1. Spam detection or in general natural language processing (nlp). For instance, using nlp in a multiclassification approach to predict medical diagnosis type from medical records (automized catalogization of diagnosis types).\n",
    "2. Scalability and performance. model is simply based on maximizing posterior joint probability for a set of input features, i.e. given a set of words, calculate the joint probability (weighted by each class -prior in bayes theorem-) for each class of interest. Predict class, which exhibits the highest joint probability. as such, there is no need for computationally heavy approaches like gradient descent to infer \"typical\" model parameters (coefficients used in underlying hypothesis). this is especially true when dealing with large feature space typically occuring in the field of natural language processing.\n",
    "3. \"Naive\" model, which assumes feature independence (not true for real world datasets). This assumptions might very much underestimate \"true\" model complexity and, thus, introduce a bias.\n",
    "4. The feature/total training set ratio is relatively high (103 features after final transformation). the curse of dimensionality might kick in. Basically it becomes more difficult to represent a class (basically a class would be diluted into many \"sub-classes\" in feature space, because we don't have enough training examples to represent all/majority of class members within the available feature space. as a consequence the model would not generalize well on onseen data). Since naive bayes assumes feature independence, the curse dimensionality is less of a problem, thus reducing the effect of model overfitting (nice description of the curse of dimensionality in https://www.visiondummy.com/2014/04/curse-dimensionality-affect-classification/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression: \n",
    "1. Medical diagnostics, e.g. cancer vs. not cancer or risk-assessment for developing certain deseases \n",
    "2. Model interpretability (parameters provide information how different features are associated with outcome variable, both how strong (size of feature coefficient) and in which direction (does feature x exhibit a positive or negative correlation with outcome variable; feature weights are signed)). Again this is usefull in the context of medical diagnostics. For instance, a probability score of 51% of having cancer is 51% would result in patient x being classified as having cancer (if prediction threshold is >50%). However, such a result is inherently also less confident of the patient really having cancer, which could result in running additional diagnostics (or not unnecessarily alert the patients). In general, probability scores would help to prioritize, i.e. immediately triggering appropriate follow up diagnostics/treatment if the predicted probability score is 99%. Applying non-logistic regression models could simply result in both patients predicted as having cancer. In general, the model performs best if the underlying data is linearly seperable\n",
    "3. Low model complexity, which requires that independent and dependent variables follow a linear relationship. However, non-linearity can be compensated for if data is transformed to a higher dimension (e.g. polynomial transformation). This, on the other hand, might impose another problem. If the data already contains many features, adding new polynomial features would increase the negative effect of high-dimensional data (curse of dimensionality) and result in a model being more prone to overfitting (thus bad model generalization). \n",
    "Finaly, data should be normalized if regularization is applied. Otherwise minimizing the corresponding cost function would be highly biased towards unscaled features (a weakness, if scaling is not considered in training a regulized model).  \n",
    "4. Even after adding new polynomial features and, thus, likely increasing model variance, logistic regression might result in good overall performance if we apply regularization (reducing overfitting and, thus, increasing generalization). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods (Random Forest):  \n",
    "1. Diagnosing a disease based on high-dimensional gene expression data (leveriging the capability of random forests to handle high dimensionality data, see below). Also, random forest, although offering less interpretability as decision tree for instance, would still provide insight about feature selection. So very powerful in combination with domain knowledge.\n",
    "2. Defining complex non-linear decission boundary by combing a set of many simple models (high bias). So the end result would be a complex decision boundary that is much less prone to overfitting (because it consists of many simple -more biased- models) even if the input training dataset is not very large. In general, random forests should be a good choice with high dimensionality datasets (many features), because they are inherently less prone to overfitting. Also, random forrests/decission trees inherently conduct feature selection by maximizing information gain/minimizing impority by class for a given feature (e.g., see https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/310995/random-forests-feature-selection). Having a grasp of feature importance also helps with model interpretability (especially if one has a good grasp of domain knowledge)\n",
    "3. There is a trade-off between accuracy (in general prediction performance) and computational cost -more trees = better accuracy = increasing computational cost- (from python machine learning book by sebastian raschka). Also, a mix of multiple decision trees offers less interpretability as opposed to a single decision tree.\n",
    "4. As already stated, our dataset is of relative high dimensionality (especially in comparison to the size of the training sample) and, thus, models are prone to overfitting. The inherent nature of the random forest algorithm -using many learning hypothesis results in a final hypothesis/decision boundary that suffers less from high variance and, thus, offers better model generalization to unseen data.

    "**Answer: **  \n",
    "In general, a good model should provide good predictive power (it depends on the dataset and model context, which metrics are most suitable to evaluate the model best) wrt test set. Good predictive power on unseen data simply means that the model has a good generalization ability, i.e. it captures the essence of how the data describes different classes/cluster in the dataset).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our initial model evaluation, logistic regression and random forest exhibit similar f1-scores with the test set. Of note, the f1-score is a more suitable evaluation metric, since we have to deal with unbalanced data (only ~25% data points belong to the class >50k). As such, we would encounter 75% accuracy by merely predicting all <=50k class. As a consequence, we need a better representation of how good is the model's prediction power wrt both classes and the small sample size class, respectively. The f1-score incorporates two other metrics, namely recall and precision. Precision quantitatively evaluates how many of the predicted class 1 (here, >50k) actually truly belong to the corresponding class (how good is the model in discriminating between the classes, even if one class is underrepresented). Similarly, recall evaluates how many class 1 cases have been predicted out of the total class 1 pool (how good is the model in capturing the total number of cases for a particular class). \n",
    "The main advantage of the f1-score is that it provides a less biased average score, as opposed to the arithmetic mean, since the score is weighted more towards the smaller of the two metrics used. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of training and testing time, logistic regression exhibits better performace in comparison to the random forest classifier. In fact, random forest takes the longest to train and test (expected, because many decision trees are being fitted). However, even for random forest, it takes < 1sec to train on the full dataset. As such, hyperparameter tuning should not impose an imbearable computational burden. So overall, training and testing time are not really a relevant selection criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing training and testing f1-scores for logistic regression and random forest, it seems that logistic regression suffers from bias (lower traing and testing scores => higher training and testing error), whereas random forest appears to suffer from high variance (higher training score and lower testing score => lower training error and higher testing error). In order to compensate for the inherent bias in the logistic regression model, we could extend the feature space by polynomials. However, this might have a significant impact on the computational cost wrt model training. Also, it would require to gather much more data (due to curse of dimensionality) to fit a model, which has good generalization properties (good predictive power on unseen data)!! \n",
    "That's why I would prefer random forest over logistic regression. In general, random forest is a more complex model that should be able to fit the default data without requiring more features."

    "The basic building block of the random forest algorithm is the decision tree. The idea is to use a simple linear decision boundary and try to divide the data along a single feature space in a way that maximizes class purity, i.e. as many class 1 members on one side of the decision boundary versus as many class 2 members on the other side. Furthermore, decision trees are inherently hierarchical in terms of how a feature is selected at each tree branch. The feature that results in highest class purity after the split will be prefered over all other features. This is repeated until either all the features have been used or until a certein branch/tree level has been reached. A single decision tree that is part of the \"random forest\" ensemble is always constructed using a random sample from the training dataset with replacement. This process is called bagging, and each random sub-sample is refered to as boostrap sample (Udacity ML nanodegree notes).\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination of all the simple decision boundaries (one boundary for each feature used) results in a complex final boundary that potentially can model complex datasets. However this model complexity results in decision trees being inherently prone to overfitting, especially when using many features. \n",
    "\n",
    "By training many simple (shallow, using only a few of the cognate feature subset) decision trees -each trained only on a small subset of the total feature set- random forest algorithm actually aims at reducing overfitting from which single decision trees suffer. The final prediction result is thus inferred from these multiple decision trees applying a simple majority vote (which class was predicted more often by the entire ensemble of decision trees).  "

We can observe a significant improvment to the naive predictor, resulting in 244% and 145% improvment in Accuracy-score and F-score, respectively. In terms of accuracy, this is expected, since we have unbalanced class distribution and the naive predictor focused on predicting the smaller size class. Nevertheless, using a naive predictor that only predicts class 0 (bigger size class), the final optimized predictor would still exhibit an improvement of 15%.\n",

    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I would have conducted an exploratory data analysis, visualizing feature distributions for both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**age:** it is likely that on average, individuals will have a higher income with increasing age. In general, higher age equals higher experience, which usually equals better compensation wrt salary. On the other hand, lower age (e.g., <25) is indicative of individuals still pursuing education, especially higher education (university degree). As such, these individuals are more likely to be on the lower end of the income distribution (however, this is changing due to digitalization and more jobs in the IT/tech sector. Here, there is likely already a significant number of young people with high incomes). Also, depending on the age distribution in the dataset, individuals below a certain age, e.g. 18, are very likely to not yet entered the job market. Consequently, age < 18 would be a very good indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**education:** There are several statistics on correlation between education and income, showing a positive trend with increasing level of education (e.g., https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-connection-between-ed_b_1066401).\n",
    "\n",
    "**education_num:** I would assume education_num as one of the most significant features, because it is directly related to education, for which I assume a high rank in terms of feature importance. In fact, it is the quantitative representation of the same feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "**occupation:** in general occupation correlates to a certain degree with education. For instance, I would suspect mostly a college degree accompanying exec_managerial roles. Conversely, I would assume on average lower education level for individuals refering to handlers-cleaners role as occupation). As aforementioned, I assume education to have high predictive power and because of the suspected correlation between occupation and education, I would assume that occupation will also exhibit high rank. \n",
    "\n",
    "**hours:** in general research data shows that working hours and GDP, which correlates with income, exhibit a negative correlation (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdppercapita-vs-annual-hours-worked). However, if we only conduct a \"within country\" comparison, there is evidence that high earners tend to work longer hours (https://www.nber.org/digest/jul06/w11895.html). I assume that the underlying dataset is merely a representation of US households. As such, I assume hours to appear in the top 5 ranking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wrt occupation and hours, it is very difficult to estimate, which feature has inherently better predictive power. This can be significantly different depending on the representation of cases included. E.g., if the dataset contains a great proportion of people working in academia, lower-income individuals, who might also work more than 1 job (canonical scenaria in US) and a large proportion of high-income professional from non-academic fields, the effect of hours might get \"neutralised\", resulting in lower predictive power. However, I assume that the dataset is demographically representative and, thus, hours to have good predictive power. Discriminative power of the feature occupation might be lower if the feature set is not specific enough, i.e. a managerial role can be translated into supermarket employee, who is rather at the lower end of the income distribution, whereas the same role associated with a bank/big company is rather indicative of higher income. As such, occupation might have less predictive power (lower ranking) compared to hours.  "

    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "3 out of 5 features were guessed correctly, namely: age, hours, education (number representation). As already mentioned, age is a good indicator, because it is logically connected to the world's economical model:\n",
    "\n",
    "<16-18: childhood (unlikely to have an income)\n",
    "18-25/28: young adults pursuing education and/or first job opportunities (first income)\n",
    "28-40: adults, who gained more experience in their respective field (more experience=higher income)\n",
    "40-60: senior adults with even more experience, which might result in even higher compensation \n",
    "\n",
    "As such increasing age likely results in increasing income. Hours per week is in agreement with results from research mentioned in the section above (higher income correlating with increasing age). Actually it makes sense that only the numerical representation of education (education_num variable) is amongst the most relevant features. Education is a categorical variable and as such, required to be transformed to multiple dummy variables (1 indicating the case belongs to the sub-group present in the original variable), each representing a category in education. Instead only one of the sub-categories -now a standalone feature- could be present amongst the most important features. Here, I would assume that one of the highest academic subgroups (Doctorate, Masters) would provide a good discriminative power to predict high income individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital-gain, which was not included in my top 5 list, is the rise in value of capital assets, such as real-estate and investment (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp). It makes sense to invest money that is not required to cover expenses of living. Consequently, it is more likely that high/-er income individuals have this kind of \"extra\" money and. In fact, increasing capital-gain suggests higher initial investment, which in turn likely correlates with more available capital for investment and higher income, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was suprised to see that relation husband (basically equivalent to being married) ranks in top 5 wrt feature importance. I was assuming to find equal proportions of maried individuals across both income classes. Based on this assumption, I was expecting less discriminative power. However, the data exhibits a strong correlation between being married and husband, respectively, and belonging to >50K class (~76% of all high-income (>50K) individuals are married vs. ~30% individuals in lower-income (<=50K); see overview below) "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "Decreasing the number of features to fit the model reduces the test data F-score by. 7.3%. As already mentioned, the discrepancy in F-scores between training and testing data (higher score for training data), is indicative of high model variance and overfitting, respectively. \n",
    "Based on this assumption it is a reasonable strategy to reduce the number of features (introducing more bias and also applied in gridsearch). Nevertheless, the results indicate that the selected feature subset is too small and we removed features that would add valuable predictive power to the trained model. \n",
    "I would not consider using the smaller features subset at the cost of model accuracy. The reason being is that the overall training time is still very short (as opposed to deep learning models using millions/billions of training data) in comparison to the upside of having a more precise (identifying more high-income individuals) model. As donations are inherently probabilistic, reaching out to potential individuals who are more likely to donate can be directly translated into a higher expected value of total money donated. Consequently, the company should be keen on maximizing the probability of receiving donations (by reaching out to more high-potential donors), which is factored in by having a more precise model.  "
